# Raffle Project

Welcome to the Raffle Project! This is a simple application designed to manage and run raffles.

This project is suuuper simple, because I just made it to test out some skills and to solve a REAL-LIFE problem! I needed a raffle system, so I went ahead and built my own.

I know it would be cool to add authentication, make it client-based, set up and architect it better, improve and prettify the interface, and all that... But just being able to do all this already makes me extremely happy.

## Features

- Add participants to the raffle.
- Randomly select a winner.
- Easy-to-use interface.

## How to Use (Docker is Required)

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JoaoMendesG/raffle.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
